# Conway's Game of Life

This is a command line python script that plays random simulations of Conway's Game of Life. 

It was made with python3. You can modify the size of the board, the maximum initial population(living cells) and the number of generations desired. The board is filled randomly.

The script uses the clear linux command for making the game clear. If you are in windows, before using the script, change this clear to the windows similar.
